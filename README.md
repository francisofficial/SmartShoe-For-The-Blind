# Smart Shoe for the Blind ðŸ‘Ÿ

## Overview
The Smart Shoe for the Blind is an assistive technology solution designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate safely using vibration alerts and obstacle detection. 

This project aims to integrate **AI and embedded systems** to detect obstacles and notify users through vibration feedback. 

This repository will contain the software simulation (built with Flask + MySQL) and future hardware integration details.

---

## Features (Planned)
- Obstacle detection simulation (distance sensors)
- Vibration feedback system (simulated)
- User-friendly dashboard interface (Flask web app)
- Data logging using MySQL database
- Future AI module for predictive obstacle avoidance

---

## Tech Stack
- Python (Flask Framework)
- MySQL Database
- HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)
- AI Components (for future enhancement)

---

## Current Status
This repository currently serves as the base for project documentation and upcoming implementation. 
Development is ongoing as part of the **Power Learn Project (PLP)** specialization in AI for Software Engineering.

---

## Future Plans
- Connect real sensors via Arduino or Raspberry Pi
- Deploy AI model for smart obstacle prediction
- Develop a mobile companion app
